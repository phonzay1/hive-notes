# Hive Notes

Hive Notes is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot that transcribes handwritten notes and allows users to query those notes using natural language.

## Features
- **Digitization and semantic storage of handwritten notes**: Handwritten notes are transcribed using the OpenAI API and stored alongside vector embeddings that capture their meaning.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: When a user asks a question, the query is embedded and compared to stored note embeddings using vector similarity search. Relevant notes are retrieved and passed to an LLM to generate a contextual answer.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A React-based frontend allows users to ask questions about their notes using natural language.
